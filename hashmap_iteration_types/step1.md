# Clone the Github Repo

We'll start the scenario by cloning a Github repo that I've already readied. This will save us time that you'll not waste in writing boilerplat code. So execute the following command (by clicking on it), to clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/contactsunny/HashMap_Iteration_Types.git`{{execute}}

You should now see the code in your editor.

Let's now build the project, run the following command:

`mvn clean install`{{execute}}

Once the project is built, we'll just have to run it. To run the project and see the output, run the following command:

`java -jar target/hashmap_iteration_poc-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`{{execute}}

And that's it!
